*Overview*

This dataset contains detailed information about patient medical appointments from a healthcare facility, capturing a wide range of variables that collectively influence whether a patient attends or misses their scheduled appointment. The primary focus of this dataset is to study patient behavior, understand appointment adherence patterns, and analyze various factors that correlate with no-shows in a clinical environment.
The dataset includes patient demographic information such as age and gender, as well as socioeconomic indicators like participation in a government-supported scholarship program. In addition, it contains important clinical variables including the presence of chronic medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, and handicap status. These fields allow analysts to explore how specific health factors and comorbidities affect a patient’s likelihood of attending their scheduled visit.
The dataset further captures behavioral and temporal elements like whether the patient received an SMS reminder, the exact date the appointment was created (ScheduledDay), the day the visit was supposed to occur (AppointmentDay), the difference between these dates (waiting period), and the weekday on which appointments were scheduled. Such variables are essential to evaluate logistical and time-based influences on patient attendance.
One of the most valuable elements is the *NoShow* outcome column, which reveals whether each patient attended (`No`) or missed (`Yes`) their appointment. This makes the dataset highly suitable for predictive modeling, enabling the development of machine learning classification models that estimate the probability of attendance based on historical patterns.
Overall, this dataset is well-suited for exploratory data analysis, business analytics, healthcare operational studies, and statistical modeling. It offers rich opportunities for visualizations, correlation studies, medical behavior research, and model-based insights. Researchers and data analysts can leverage this dataset to identify risk factors, reduce clinical inefficiencies, improve patient follow-up strategies, and enhance the quality of healthcare delivery through data-driven prediction and intervention.
